Lending Club Case Study

LendingClub is an online lending platform that connects borrowers with investors. It primarily offers personal loans, small business loans, and auto refinancing. The platform uses technology to simplify the borrowing process and provides an alternative to traditional banking institutions.


When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company

If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

## General Information
 Objective is to create a more efficient and transparent financial marketplace by leveraging technology to streamline the lending process, reduce costs, and offer better terms for both borrowers and investors compared to traditional financial institutions.
 With the 'Loan'  dataset provided comapny wants to understand which variable potentially leads to the default case.

 Primary objective is to identify the loop hole in the process and mitigate the credit loss.
## Conclusion
Small business borrowers have a higher likelihood of defaulting.​

Borrowers with public bankruptcies are more prone to default.​

Higher debt-to-income (DTI) ratios are associated with increased defaults.​

Long-term loans have higher default rates, suggesting a focus on short-term loans may reduce risk.​

The current verification process is ineffective; institutions should strengthen it.​

Extra caution is advised when lending to borrowers with homeownership status listed as "Others."​

Lenders should exercise caution when approving loans for lower-income borrowers.
